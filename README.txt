DOS
===
the text file .txt contain directories and file names for computed energy levels of each system.

1d_schrodinger.F can be used to compute rovibrational energy levels for a morse potential and can simply be modified for any other 1d potential.

running the following commands will run a simple example calculation.
$python dos_molecule_molecule.py should provide the same output as the text file output_dos_molecule_molecule.txt 
$python dos_atom_molecule.py should provide the same output as the text file output_dos_atom_molecule.txt 

have fun!
