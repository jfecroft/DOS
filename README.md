DOS
===

Density of states lifetime calculations. Calculates density of states (dos) and lifetime as described in the papers
-Statistical Aspects of Ultracold Resonant Scattering-- M. Mayle, B. P. Ruzic, and J. L. Bohn, Phys. Rev. A 85, 062712 (2012).
-Scattering of Ultracold Molecules in the Highly Resonant Regime -- M. Mayle, G. Qu√©ner, B. P. Ruzic, and J. L. Bohn, Phys. Rev. A 87, 012709 (2013).
Lifetimes are computed from rovibrational energy level data contained in the folder data.
The data files used in the papers and 
-Long-Lived Complexes and Chaos in Ultracold Molecular Collisions  J. F. E. Croft and J. L. Bohn, Phys. Rev. A 89, 102714 (2014). 
are provided.
